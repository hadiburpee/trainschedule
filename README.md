# trainschedule

This is the readme for the trainschedule app.

This app is meant for a train schedule administrator to add trains to a database.  The train scheduler uses moment js to calculate the next train time based on the first train time of the day and the frequency that the train arrives.  I also included a button that clears the schedule/database.
